## Assignment Overview

This repository contains solutions for **Simulation and Modeling Lab – Assignment 01**, which focuses on basic matrix operations and data visualization using Python.

---

## Assignment 1: Basic Matrix Operations

### Task

* Create two **3×3 matrices** with random integers.
* Perform the following operations:

  * Matrix Addition
  * Matrix Subtraction
  * Matrix Multiplication
* Compute:

  * Determinant
  * Inverse (if the matrix is non-singular)
  * Rank

### Concepts Used

* NumPy array operations
* Linear algebra functions (`np.linalg`)
* Matrix properties and transformations

---

## Assignment 2: Matrix Plotting and Visualization

### Task

* Generate two datasets containing random float values.
* Flatten the data into 1D vectors.
* Plot both datasets on the same graph.
* Add:

  * Axis labels
  * Title
  * Legend
  * Grid

### Concepts Used

* Random number generation
* Data flattening
* Data visualization using Matplotlib

---

## Libraries Used

```python
numpy
matplotlib
sympy (optional)
seaborn (optional)
```

Install required libraries:

```
pip install numpy matplotlib sympy seaborn
```
